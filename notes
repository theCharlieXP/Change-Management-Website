  Summary of Results

create a feature within the Insights page where once you make a search and the results cards appear a new green button appears called "Summarise Results" that when you press it it will create a summary of all the results cards and display it above the results cards. The summary should include the following:
  Summary of Results
  Key Findings
  Patterns
  Follow-up Questions to Learn More
  References

  the summary should be generated by deepseek and should be formatted by having the headings and then concise and informative bullet points underneath each heading.
  the summary should be based on the insight focus area that the user selected for the original search.
  The summary should have a notes text area where the user can add any additional notes about the summary under the summary.
  The summary should have a button to save the summary to a project.

I am creating a website that is going to help change managers or help companies that don't have change managers execute change-related projects. My thinking behind this is that I'm currently just starting my career within change management, so I think that it could be great for my learning and development by creating this platform as it allows me to think about change management as a practice and what tools can be created to help them and learn skills along the way. I also think will be useful for when I want to look at the next step of my career when I'm applying for jobs and I can say that I have created this website and like people can go on here and like try it try it out and use it and see how well it's made how useful it is and they're going to make me a bit more interesting and more employable to show that I can work because I have no coding experience. I'm using the Cursor app on my computer to create this website with no coding experience, so I think that can show that I'm creative and working with the technology updates at the times and it shows I can adapt and learn new things and create tools from scratch. 

I haven't put this website on the web yet. So far, what I've created is a landing page which is what you'll get to go on to when you first go onto the website. On that, there's a few different points about what sort of things the website is going to do. You can sign in with your Google account, and that takes you to the dashboard. When you enter the dashboard, you can see the option to create a project. When you create a project, there'll be an option to add tasks that you can rearrange and put different statuses on it, edit and write some notes about the project. There's another page called insights where there's a search bar where you can input something you want to get some insights on that's related to change management. There's filters so you have to select an insight focus area (lessons learned, outcomes, best practices) for the search to focus on. You can filter by the industry and then when you click Search, it goes through the internet and finds relevant sources. It uses AI to create concise bullet point summaries based on the insight focused area that was selected. Then it comes back with result cards containing a title and the summaries. You can go through them and write notes at the bottom of them if you find them interesting. If you want to keep it, you can save it to a project so that it's stored within that project page.Once you do a search, you can then press Generate Insight. The AI collates all of the result cards that were produced from that search and creates a summary organised in the headings of Summary of Results, Key Findings, Patterns and Follow-up Questions to Learn More. Which you can then also add notes to and save to a project. So then once you do various searches on the insights page and savings to the project then you'll have a collection of insights with focusing on different areas regarding change management that you can then use to help you make significant change within a company.
